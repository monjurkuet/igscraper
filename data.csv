‚Å£
Photo of me by @megantoriglia. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Just wanted to check in to say HELLO to you all and remind you that I‚Äôm still around despite my lack of posting. As I mentioned in my last post I am either 100% or none at all lately and I‚Äôm trying to find that balance again!‚Å£
‚Å£
I‚Äôd also love to take this time to introduce myself to new followers! If you‚Äôve just started following me you‚Äôll notice my feed is full of my work but not much about myself so I wanted to give you a little more insight!‚Å£
‚Å£
I was born in England but moved to NY in my early twenties - and I'm still here! They say if you‚Äôve been in NY over 10 years you are a true New Yorker, but I still feel very British. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I have been a photographer for over half of my life. Fun fact - I have never had another job (despite doing one day work experience at the Asda / Walmart photo counter and hated it).‚Å£
I started shooting at 14 years old when digital photography was in its early stages and everyone (including myself) heavily used and relied on Photoshop. How many of you remember DeviantART and Flickr?!‚Å£
I haven‚Äôt always been a fashion/beauty photographer - my first love was fine art portraiture & self-portraits. I am self-taught, and I have always been crafty (a skill that comes in handy on many of my jobs today!). ‚Å£
‚Å£
I got into fashion photography because I loved the collaboration aspect of working with a team and sharing ideas. Even when I shot fine-art photography, I dreamed of shooting for publications and would find myself staring in awe at the pages of international fashion print magazines. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I moved to NY because a last minute trip made me realize I needed a change. In my early twenties I visited the city to see friends and explore and instantly fell in love with the creative energy and hustle of the industry. I met my husband on one of those early trips and here we are many years later!‚Å£
‚Å£
Today I am working a lot with a variety of fashion & beauty/clients and even though I've been doing this a long time, sometimes I have to pinch myself and remind myself what 14 year old Lara would have thought of me now living my dream!‚Å£

CqdVqICOMxV,9702158,5918,"I just realized that it‚Äôs been over a month since I posted here on Instagram.. which is a little odd for me! I‚Äôve been utilizing social media for SO many years that sometimes I get this guilt from not sharing enough.. but truly, I am also enjoying a little break away and to live in the moment, even on set! I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and we were wondering whether it was age, being comfortable with just being present and not having to ‚Äòshare‚Äô as much. Either way, I‚Äôm still trying to find that balance because I‚Äôm either an ALL IN or out completely kind of person lately! So I thought I‚Äôd share some of my story highlights over the last few weeks, as life has been busy but I just don‚Äôt have any creative or published projects projects to show (just yet).

A few highlights recently:
‚ñ™Ô∏èSet life with @lancomeofficial shooting beauty! 
‚ñ™Ô∏èSlide 2/3 glimpses of my new studio that I‚Äôm now sharing with @emilysoto in NY! So exciting. 
‚ñ™Ô∏èCoffee and brunch dates with @megantoriglia (my favorite Canadian) who came to visit for 3 weeks. I miss her already
‚ñ™Ô∏èSet from @buxomcosmetics campaign who I‚Äôve been working with a lot lately
‚ñ™Ô∏èInspiration visits to photo galleries and exhibitions in NY. Stopping at @patrickdemarchelier @victordemarchelier gallery @staleywisegallery and @fotografiska.newyork - I was very inspired by @elizavetaporodina who‚Äôs work sang to my fine art photography heart.

‚Å£
https://www.larajadeeducation.com/pdf-guides/fashion-posing-guide (link in bio)‚Å£
‚Å£
The concept of this guide came to me quite a few years ago when I realized there wasn‚Äôt much information out there on successful fashion posing. Everything I saw felt outdated and geared towards glamor/portrait photography! It was there and then that I decided that I needed to make a change for the better and I started teaching more about fashion posing during my in-person workshops.‚Å£
‚Å£
Two years ago I launched ‚ÄòThe Light Guide‚Äô and the feedback blew me away. I was amazed at how many of you took a chance on learning fashion lighting from me and I still get excited every time someone tells me how much my techniques helped them! Like lighting, posing is very visual, and I soon realized that having a tangible visual product (in the same way I use visual posing references on set) would benefit so many of you there! If you liked The Light Guide you will love The Fashion Posing Guide! ‚Å£
‚Å£
This guide features many of my go-to methods & tried and tested techniques as well as over 150+ poses to reference from in the form of the themed posing guides. Find out my favorite classic/romantic poses, edgy, dynamic & cover poses! ‚Å£
‚Å£
You don‚Äôt have to be a fashion photographer to benefit from this - portrait & bridal photographers can utilize the guide by learning modern posing techniques!‚Å£

Introducing you to 3 Style Packs - Fashion Foundations, Vintage Tones & Black & White.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
After years of photographers asking me what my go-to toning recipes are, I can finally share my toning preferences with you. I previously shared my Lightroom & Photoshop recipes but it made sense to launch presets via the program I use exclusively on all of my photoshoot sets! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
For the past 6+ years now, I‚Äôve used the program Capture One. It really is the gold standard in image workflow and is used in the commercial world by the majority of all fashion, beauty & portrait clients. ‚Å£‚Å£
These past few months I have found myself wondering why I hadn‚Äôt saved my previous recipes for future shoots because it would make my life so much easier. Having a foundation to work from & ideas for toning direction speed up workflow & inspire new ideas. I find myself doing the same toning adjustments on almost every shoot (sometimes a little tweak here and there). Then it got me thinking, I should be sharing these! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I am so proud of how these 3 Style Packs turned out. Those that know me know I can‚Äôt launch a product without putting my heart and soul into it. I always like to create these products alone without help because that way I get the utmost control of how they turn out and how they reflect my personal style. I really leaned into & listened to what I thought you‚Äôd all want to know from me & I can‚Äôt wait for you to try them out! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
üí¨ Do you have any questions regarding image toning or these new presets? Feel free to ask below!",2023-11-18 19:56:20,

I had such a great time creating these images alongside the students. One piece of advice I always give on these events is to not be afraid to work and experiment out of your comfort zone. For years I struggled with this until a year is so ago I started feeling comfortable with getting more creative and it opened up a lot more doors for me! So, here‚Äôs your weekly reminder to try something new and maybe sprinkle in a little weirdness. You never know, it might just surprise you!‚Å£

‚Å£
With it being my first in depth photography class, there was SO much I wanted to teach. Fashion Photography is such a HUGE topic in itself that I found it hard to keep it under the 20 hour mark! ‚Å£
‚Å£
The Fashion Series is jam packed with educational content on lighting, posing, styling & then real life shoot scenarios. In these scenarios you see how I make it happen with restrictions we all face on a day to day basis as creatives - time, money, space, access to models and teams etc.‚Å£
The course is both educational and inspirational and will help kickstart that creative fire. ‚Å£

There‚Äôs also 3 downloadable PDFs you can use to support your creativity - including a lighting guide, posing guide and styling resource guide.‚Å£

‚Å£‚Å£
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of your comments and DMs about how you find studio lighting intimidating! Believe me, I have been there. Learning a new skill doesn‚Äôt happen overnight and it probably took me longer than most! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
When I started out all I knew and felt inspired by was natural light and how to shape it. The studio environment felt clinical to me.‚Å£ During the first 6-7 years of my career my entire portfolio consisted of soft light location photography which was great for me as it was what I loved.. but I also lacked lighting diversity in my portfolio and I would miss job opportunities because I didn‚Äôt show other skills. Looking back I know studio lighting was a big insecurity of mine and it showed. There was NO education out there back then and I often felt frustrated when trying to pick out gear and learn new set ups. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Fast forward some years later when I moved to NY 2010. I decided to jump in the deep end and it was hard. I HAD to start shooting more commercially which went putting myself into an uncomfortable learning zone. I learned a lot from trial and error, from watching others but more importantly - pure experimentation and curiosity. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I am booked as a photographer because I specialize in a photography style BUT I show variety in my portfolio. By showing more of a skill set I am attracting a variety of clients and thus expanding my opportunities. I truly believe the most successful photographers out there are the ones that never stop learning! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I created the lighting guide because I wanted to make professional looking setups more accessible and give you an insight into how I‚Äôve made it possible. Believe me, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many lights you use or what brand you use, using 10 lights on one set doesn‚Äôt equal a successful set up. It‚Äôs about your understanding and control of the light & WHY you are using it. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
I truly hope you enjoy reading through the lighting theory & utilizing the 20+ lighting setups I‚Äôve put into the guide. I spent weeks creating this to be something special! I would LOVE to hear how the guide has helped you & see your results! ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

become more confident with studio lighting!¬†
Why limit yourself with just a few set ups when there are endless lighting recipes out there & new lighting discoveries to be found?

The lighting diagrams I share are some of my favorite set ups that work for fashion, beauty, portrait, lifestyle & even bridal shoots!

Use this guide to -
‚Ä¢ Learn more about my lighting style, methods & equipment.
‚Ä¢ Study & try out new lighting set ups (with the 24 lighting diagrams
included in the PDF!).
‚Ä¢ Understand the theory of studio lighting.
‚Ä¢ Gain confidence in the studio & when using new equipment!
‚Ä¢ Help you understand what equipment to purchase or rent.
‚Ä¢ How to connect light & mood together for successful shoots!
‚Ä¢ Find inspiration & find new ideas.

I don‚Äôt usually share a ton of personal stuff on here but I wanted to give you a little insight into what I‚Äôve been up to (and the reason why I‚Äôve been a little quiet online!)‚Å£
‚Å£
At the end of June we moved to a new home just outside of NY. This is our first home purchase and was much needed after ten years in the city. We spent months looking and finally found a dream spot to grow and to get a better live/work balance!‚Å£
‚Å£
You‚Äôd think the move would be easy going from an apartment to a home but we had accumulated so much stuff (mostly all of my heavy photo EQ) & it was a lot to manage. They say everything happens at once and it really did.. two weeks before we were due to close on the house my dog Stella got diagnosed with mast cell cancer! Luckily we caught the cancer early but it was still a scary surgery and we were very anxious to not only see her go through that but knowing that we‚Äôd be moving during her recovery! (Fast forward she ripped her stitches open getting too excited in the new home!)‚Å£
‚Å£
So if you‚Äôve been wondering why I‚Äôve been a little quiet, there you go! I‚Äôm quite enjoying the process of unpacking, using my outside deck as a workspace & slowly figuring out how each room will look. I‚Äôm still settling in and figuring out the new way of life (and have to learn to drive!) but I love the change and excited to see what the future has in store for us here. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I‚Äôve also been taken back by the wonderful feedback you guys have left on my recent product ‚ÄòThe Light Guide‚Äô. There have been so many lovely comments & reviews and I always LOVE seeing the results after you put the light set ups into practice! Keep them coming! ‚Å£
‚Å£
Im looking forward to sharing more work with you soon. I already have a huge list of project ideas & I‚Äôd love to hear what you‚Äôd like to see from me in the future (whether social content or educational product ideas I‚Äôm all ears). ‚Å£

CLps4J8AFd7,9702158,2937,"Photographers! Tell me.. what are your goals when it comes to getting your work published? ‚Å£
‚Å£
Perhaps you are really new to the submission process? Perhaps you‚Äôre a portrait photographer looking to expand into fashion photography to attract more clients? Or perhaps you‚Äôve already started to get your work published and want to up your game a little?‚Å£
‚Å£
üí° Think of editorial work as a place to gain the ultimate control over your creative vision. It's what sells your work as a photographer. If you only showed paid work in your portfolio the variety of styles shown could be confusing to potential clients. Why? The final product in advertising work is someone else's vision and idea, even if you helped execute it. ‚Å£
If you shoot weddings and portraits, you are most likely creating someone else's vision. This doesn't always reflect the best of your ability. What ultimately sells your work is your signature vision. Clients love seeing your personal vision.‚Å£
‚Å£
üëâüèª A healthy balance of commercial and editorial work is what it takes to succeed. Your editorial work is the gateway to getting those advertising jobs (or simply an opportunity create beautiful marketing material if you are a portrait photographer!). ‚Å£

‚Å£
On today‚Äôs post I wanted to focus on my online course The Fashion Series. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost been 3 years since it was filmed! I had a blast filming it and was constantly in fits of laughter with the team (scroll to the end to find a blooper video!).‚Å£
‚Å£
www.thefashionseries.com‚Å£
‚Å£
Thousands of you around the globe have watched and put the techniques into practice! It‚Äôs been amazing to see how many of you are using my lighting, posing, styling & creative techniques on your own shoots! ‚Å£
‚Å£
I‚Äôd love to answer your questions about the course below OR perhaps you already own  the series? What‚Äôs your favorite lesson? What have you learned from the course?‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èHow did the idea come about?‚Å£
I realized a few years ago that it would be impossible to reach all of you with my in person workshops so I decided to put together a course that not only is educational but inspirational - for all levels of photographers!‚Å£
‚Å£
I remember when my friend @suebrycephotographer reached out to me with a concept in mind, which was partly inspired by a video I did with DigitalRev called ‚ÄòThe Cheap Camera Challenge‚Äô. The overall theme of the video was to prove that equipment doesn‚Äôt matter and in the end creativity is what shines through. Hands up if you‚Äôve watched it! ‚Å£
Sue and I talked and I loved the idea but also had been keen to do a breakdown of the fashion fundamentals (styling, posing and lighting) so we merged the two ideas together! ‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat is The Fashion Series?‚Å£
The Fashion Series is a two-part online photography course that breaks down both the fundamentals and inspirational challenges and is over 16 + hours of content and includes 3 essential PDF downloads on lighting, posing & styling!‚Å£
‚Å£
The course has a large focus on portfolio building. I think this is essential to any photographer at any level. As a young photographer I learnt very early on that consistently building the portfolio helped me find my style and gave me a competitive edge and also a way to pitch to my dream clients. ‚Å£

‚Å£
Over the next few days I wanted to highlight a few of my educational products and give you a little insight into each one to give you more of a personal perspective! Feel free to ask anything related to toning, I‚Äôd love to help answer any questions or give you more insight! ‚Å£
‚Å£
Today I want to focus on IMAGE TONING and talk about my recently launched Photoshop Actions & Lightroom Presets. www.larajadeeducation.com‚Å£ (link in bio)
‚Å£
‚û°Ô∏è SCROLL THROUGH to see some of my favorite before/afters from both sets! ‚Å£
‚Å£
These presets were born out of the idea of wanting to make toning easier. I get sooo many questions regarding color toning on a daily basis & the easiest way for me to answer is to simply ‚Äòshow‚Äô you! ‚Å£
Toning was a real pain point for me when I first started out, especially being a self taught photographer (and let‚Äôs be honest a little stubborn with wanting to learn the theory of anything!). I struggled to understand the process of color and I longed for someone to give me their recipe(s)! ‚Å£
‚Å£
When creating both my Lightroom Presets and Photoshop Actions I thought about the themes and concepts I often shoot and how I approach color differently each time. Color should really be approached in the same way you approach each puzzle piece of a shoot - the lighting piece, the posing piece, the styling piece. What effect does this color tone have on the image? What effect does this toning have on the skin tone? How does it effect the product? Does it enhance the mood? ‚Å£
‚Å£
All of my preset collections have a specific theme. My Photoshop Actions are structured into ‚ÄòEssential Color‚Äô packs which feature my favorite toning recipes for location & studio photography. My Lightroom Presets have various themes. The photography set consists of Fashion Film, Vintage Tones, Black & White and The Influence Pack has been created for lifestyle photographers, bloggers, influencers (and for those photographers that shoot more street style influencer / portrait focused content!) ‚Å£
‚Å£
üí° Toning is a big part of your visual style as a photographer. In fact my style of toning has been a helping factor in clients deciding whether they want to work with me! ‚Å£",2023-11-18 20:19:00,
CLE8dSkgkxj,9702158,4789,"THE BUSINESS OF PHOTOGRAPHY‚Å£
‚Å£
In today‚Äôs post I want to focus on ‚ÄòThe Business Of Fashion Photography‚Äô - my online course for photographers who want to learn more about the business and marketing side of the industry!‚Å£
‚Å£
www.larajadebusiness.com‚Å£
‚Å£
I‚Äôd love to answer your questions about the course below! If you already own the class what topics did you find most beneficial and why? Have you been able to put the work into practice? I‚Äôd love to hear your insight! ‚Å£
‚Å£
Scroll through to view some of my favorite highlights from the series (Influencer Shoot, Brand Collaboration Shoot & Small Market Big Profit!).‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat is The Business Of Fashion Photography?‚Å£
‚Å£
An online course of Over 11+ hours of comprehensive business education centered around business and marketing to help grow your sales. The series takes you through business set up, pricing your work, social media techniques and identifying potential clients. There‚Äôs also 3 inspirational photoshoots that share how I approach every shoot opportunity with a business mindset (and explain why you should too!)‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èHow did the idea come about?‚Å£
‚Å£
There are countless creative classes out there featuring lighting, posing & workflow techniques but there is nothing on the BUSINESS of commercial photography! Wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Å£
‚Å£
When I first got into the industry it was off there was a thick red curtain separating me and business information. I found that a lot of photographers were secretive.‚Å£ The only way I could learn was through trial and error and picking up little tidbits through hearsay and colleagues! It was frustrating to say the least! ‚Å£
‚Å£
When creating the concept for The Business Of Fashion Photography I wanted to create something unique and unlike any other photography class out there. I wanted to open the curtain and share the information that has helped me become a better photographer in business. ‚Å£
‚Å£
üí° To get noticed in this industry you need to be on top of your marketing game, it isn‚Äôt just about talent. People don‚Äôt just stumble across you, you have to go after opportunities! You have to put the work in front of the right eyes & think like an agent. ‚Å£

Instead I‚Äôll reflect on all of the positive creative moments this year. Creating in darkness to help see the light. Continuing to do what I love & collaboration has really helped me get through the last few months and I‚Äôve been able to produce some of my favorite shoots to date! Thank you to everyone who trusted me with year - including the clients (you know who you are) and my fellow creatives.. ‚ù§Ô∏è

1. Cover shoot with actress Daisy Ridley for @harpersbazaarmy. Shot in London before the world turned upside down! 

2. The lovely @josephine_letutour for @issue_official. My last shoot before lockdown early March.

3. The inspiring @officialashleyturner photographed in my studio.. first shoot back in the studio! After months of not shooting it felt SO good to collaborate with a team again! 

4. Collaboration with whimsical brand @cucculellishaheen - who got me back into location shooting!

5. Muse @aamitolagum in my studio, she‚Äôs been a regular face in my portfolio & is an amazing collaborator.

6. 70s beauty @daniwitt and her inspiring face! This shoot inspired me to shoot more beauty.. 

7. Cover shoot with the lovely @aamitolagum for @issue_official.

8. Fresh beauty with @mariqueschimmel - working more on my beauty folio and mastering simplicity!

9. Painterly beauty @dien4sty - this reminded me of my early work.. it was a good note to end the year on - to push creativity in the studio!

10. A self portrait. I started my career shooting these & I‚Äôd forgotten what it was like to be in front of the camera (and how frustrating it can be)! Shooting self portraits got me through a few weeks of lockdown and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how these continue in the future! 

Happy New Year to you all and let 2021 be the year to rekindle your creative fire. I can‚Äôt wait to see where the next year will take me and hear what you are all going to be working on! üåà",2023-11-18 20:19:26,@harpersbazaarmy.

This is a course for any photographer wanting to get their feet wet in the commercial industry (getting published, finding how to identify and reach out to brands & elevate your commercial portfolio). Or perhaps you‚Äôre already working in the industry & want to learn how I market, price, research & approach the business aspect. This kind of information is rarely shared (there was nothing out there on the commercial industry when I started!) but I want to open the curtain and show you exactly how it‚Äôs done. I‚Äôve been working in the commercial industry for 14 years so you‚Äôll find a lot of tips and tricks. This course will have your acting like your own agent - making you more aware of your brand and its place in the industry.

‚Å£
Giveaway! Calling all Real Gold Jewelry LOVERS! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I love gold jewelry. Which is why when Oradina reached out to me for their photography needs I was so excited. Oradina is a third generation, NYC based solid gold jewelry brand that truly has the ‚Å£most beautiful pieces. I wanted to wear everything! Unlike some other jewelers they only offer real gold and never gold plating or ‚Å£gold vermeil since those pieces would eventually lose their initial shine and beauty. I ultimately chose the three pieces pictured ‚Å£above but really each piece is its own unique work of art. All of their jewelry is ethically sourced under the Responsible Jewelry Council, and they even list where each and every piece was made. The best part is, they're affordable too. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I'm so excited to offer ONE of you a $500 GIVEAWAY - credit to be used in their store!  Scroll down for details! ‚Å£‚Å£

‚Å£
My new Lightroom Preset Collection 'The Influence Set'. www.larajadeeducation (direct link in bio)‚Å£
‚Å£
As many of you know.. I LOVE image toning. I actually started making these for myself & to make my life easier in the toning world (especially for when I‚Äôm on the go!) but then realized they are super versatile and work beautifully on lots of content out there! I now use them primarily on my social content shots (behind the scenes, travel photos, street style portraits shot on mobile and DSLR!)‚Å£
‚Å£
These Lightroom Presets help add a vibrant, signature look to your digital content! Designed with fashion & beauty influencers, bloggers, content creators AND photographers in mind. This set works perfectly with images shot on mobile too (even if you only own the free Lightroom mobile app!).
‚Å£
ENJOY and I can't wait to see what you create with them!‚Å£

‚Å£
Hi everyone! I wanted to answer a question I get asked a few times a week! I‚Äôve been asked several times lately so wanted to share here in the group! ‚Å£
‚Å£
The 30% off offer ends today & I know a few of you may be on the fence about whether to make the jump! www.larajadebusiness.com‚Å£
‚Å£
My business course is applicable to ALL types of photographers who want to take a step into the commercial industry. Portrait, lifestyle & wedding photographers can all benefit from the knowledge of the editorial (magazine side) of the industry as publications are super important for exposure and tear sheets increase awareness and credibility.‚Å£
‚Å£
As the industry is changing and growing - we have to think about other ways we can market our work. It‚Äôs not just about specializing in one thing but opening our folio and services up to many clients - increasing our chances of getting work AND being booked more often!! For example - if you‚Äôre a portrait photographer - reaching out to salons, brands, designers, law firms, financial institutions..! However, there‚Äôs a different way of marketing & pricing when reaching out to the commercial side of the industry. ‚Å£
‚Å£
If you‚Äôve ever wanted to branch out & work with small brands - my courses helps with that! There‚Äôs also a section called ‚ÄòSmall Market - Big Profit‚Äô which is helpful to anyone living outside of a major city like NY.‚Å£
‚Å£
Any photographer will also benefit from my social media methods!‚Å£
‚Å£
Tell me..‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èDo you own the course? How has it benefited you? What section taught you the most?‚Å£
‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏èPerhaps you‚Äôre thinking of getting the course but on the fence. Can I answer any questions for you regarding the content? ‚Å£
‚Å£
üí° I created this course with many of you in mind! after 16 years in this industry I tried to create a comprehensive course that would answer all of those questions you have about the commercial industry! ‚Å£

CAalwrqAfsS,9702158,18059,"So yesterday I got the creative itch & decided to shoot some self portraits. I feel like I‚Äôve been in a bit of a funk over the past week and it‚Äôs most likely due to the fact that I haven‚Äôt been able to shoot in 2+ months! The artist inside of me is itching to get back out there! I also wanted to shoot on my new @oliphantstudio backdrop. They created the LARA backdrop & I wanted to share it with you all! I LOVE how it turned out!‚Å£
‚Å£
I put on some Stevie Nicks & danced around the studio. I have to admit a lot of the shots were ridiculous and I felt silly flapping my arms around in my fringe jacket BUT I did find some shots I loved. A few of you have reached out asking how I make this look easy but believe me I try absolutely everything posing-wise & tire myself out trying to get just ONE good shot. Whenever I shoot self portraits I always think about the character (styling wise and posing wise). I almost always use natural light & in my studio I have a mirror facing me so I can see the pose (you know, just to make sure I don‚Äôt look ridiculous even though I do!) and to tweak hair & clothing. I also use the Canon Camera Connect App so I can focus and see the composition (which helps a lot!). ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£
‚Å£I have to admit I‚Äôve been enjoying shooting self portraits as a creative outlet and to give me a little confidence boost. Usually I‚Äôm roaming around the apartment in leggings & a baggy black top! ‚Å£‚Å£

‚Å£
For many years now I‚Äôve had photographers reach out and ask me how I tone my images, how I see color, how I approach it.

I worked tirelessly for 3 weeks to create sets of color and black and white actions that give you an array of beautiful toning options.

B_DJQwMgyoW,9702158,11969,"Probably my favorite shot from my self portrait session. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like the hard light. In fact, I rarely ever shoot with harsh light. Give me diffused window light or large diffused sources of strobe lighting over harsh light any day. It‚Äôs funny out of all the shots - this one grabbed me the most. I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs different from what usually do (or would select from a shoot session). It‚Äôs me trying something new and I like seeing the change. I also think it‚Äôs because the light helps the strength of the portrait and reflects how I feel now - in control of my space and creativity, no matter what‚Äôs going on around me. I feel strong & in charge of my own bubble! ‚Å£‚Å£
Pushing myself to do this self portrait session taught me two things: ‚Å£
‚ñ™Ô∏è Be uncomfortable more often. It‚Äôs beneficial to try new techniques even though they might be unfamiliar to me. Being uncomfortable is a good thing. I always like to remind photographers in my courses/workshops that ‚Äúcomfortability is the enemy of innovation‚Äù so maybe I should start listening to my own advice more often!‚Å£‚Å£

For many years I resisted doing bridal shoots because I thought it was too different to my usual fashion work. It was too pretty, obvious, girly. 
How wrong I was.. I actually found a lot of inspiration in doing these shoots and found my voice in bridal photography. Bridal doesn‚Äôt meant overly feminine puffy white dresses. Bridal doesn‚Äôt have to mean ‚Äògirly‚Äô. Bridal can be anything. 
I love photographing a model in a deconstructed gown just as much as I like photographing a model in tulle at a Versailles inspired garden. This is why I like @daniellefrankelstudio‚Äôs designs so much and admire what she does. She has shaken up the definition of what bridal is. 
I like the challenge and contrast. I truly believe you find your style by trying new things, challenge yourself, work with new creatives.

‚Å£
It has been hard to keep this project a secret, especially because I‚Äôve been using these actions a lot lately (including my most recent self portraits!). The idea of creating Photoshop Actions that felt true to my style has been on my mind for over a year now but I‚Äôve always pushed the idea aside due to having a busy shoot schedule. Well, I finally had the time to work on them & I‚Äôm super happy with how these sets turned out! ‚Å£
‚Å£
The Essential Collections are a perfect choice for any photographer looking to add a unique editorial/fashion look to their images! Actions save you time, help streamline your workflow, assist in achieving color consistency & elevate your portfolio! They also open your eyes to new color possibilities! ‚Å£

B_Vzg39gr9k,9702158,10572,"I‚Äôm continuing to shoot self portraits & I‚Äôm finally getting my flow back! Today was all about attempting a ‚Äòheadshot‚Äô (my definition of a bio headshot may be a little different to others!)‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
In today‚Äôs industry - It‚Äôs more important than ever to represent your brand and if you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòbio‚Äô picture (or headshot) on your website or social, now is the time!! YOU are your brand and whether you like being in front of the camera or not, people like to know who they are talking to or potentially going to be working with. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I was once there - I used to hide behind my work (even though I started doing self portraits, I stopped posting photos of myself once I got into fashion photography). One day an organizer from a workshop I was teaching at said to me ‚ÄòI knew you had beautiful work but I had no idea who you were! You don‚Äôt even have a photo of you on your website!‚Äù‚Å£‚Å£
She met me at the airport but had no clue who I was when she was looking for me! That started the wheels turning & I started to re-think my social media strategy. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
You are not just a voice behind a social media account - you are an artist who has a story. You ALL have interesting stories to tell. In an industry where connection is mainly digital - personal connection is very important!‚Å£

Before I did these shots a few days ago.. I hadn‚Äôt attempted a self portrait in around 13 years! I started my career shooting them to build confidence and an initial portfolio. You learn a LOT doing self portraiture! 
Create with what you have in your home! Here are a few tips for creating them -
‚ñ™Ô∏èUse a self timer & focus on an object - replacing yourself with it when you are in front of the lens
‚ñ™Ô∏èUse a wireless or wired remote for easy focusing
‚ñ™Ô∏èUse a mirror in front of you to see what the shot may look like. This helped in my 2nd shot when seeing where the light fell on my face
‚ñ™Ô∏èUse a camera app for your phone (if available) - like Canon‚Äôs ‚ÄòCamera Connect‚Äô app. I used the live viewfinder on my phone to focus & preview the shots before taking them.",2023-11-18 20:23:33,

I thought I would share what has been inspiring me & getting me motivated over the past few weeks. James & I have been re-organizing our apartment - starting with the living area + bookshelf, equipment room and doing a good old spring clean! Organizing my bookshelf opened up a lot of motivation as it reminded me of the inspiring books I have right in front of my eyes! Some of these haven‚Äôt even been opened! (One of my favorite books is ‚ÄòThe Model As Muse‚Äô by The Met). I‚Äôve also been super inspired by self portraiture (which is what inspired my photography career all those years ago)! I‚Äôm nervous to try it again (I would be lying if I wasn‚Äôt) because it can be tedious but I haven‚Äôt done an actual self portrait with a DSLR for 13 years. My challenge this week is to challenge myself and YOU on here and in my Facebook group to get out there & create! I‚Äôd love to see some artsy self portraits utilizing the things you have at home!

I‚Äôve also been inspired to archive my work, organize drives, tax folders & get rid of old clutter. Doing the boring things on the to do list first so I can tackle the fun creative things!

Remember that right now we are not ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô at home - this is OUR TIME to create in a safe space! Use this time to re-invent yourself & build your folio while you have the time to do so!",2023-11-18 20:23:33,@suebrycephotographer
B-sg6ZdAdHS,9702158,6820,"Today I got up & had one intention - create a self portrait! It has been 13 years since I created a creative self portrait (selfies don‚Äôt count!). I started my career shooting them to hone my skills and build confidence & the technique seems so unfamiliar to me now! 
However today my mind had other plans - it was a slow morning. I didn‚Äôt feel like creating. I slept in & I felt exhausted. I think I‚Äôve been going and going over the past few weeks giving myself a million tasks - knowing that stopping my flow could potentially let some negative seep in... but I did it! I pushed through - got ready, did some emails, got my matcha, put on some tunes and just got on with it ! It was a slow process - THAT I do remember. Despite the slow process (which is so different to how I usually shoot!) - it was fun and rewarding. 
I shot this with my @canonusa EOS R & 50mm 1.2 on a tripod and used the ‚ÄòCanon Connect App‚Äô to connect to my phone. My phone then acts as a digital viewfinder so I can focus & also see what I‚Äôm doing! I then set a 10 second timer after focusing which allowed me to hide the phone & get into position! SWIPE through the images & you‚Äôll see a little recorded video I did from my phone. 
I‚Äôd LOVE for you to join me in this challenge! If you create one tag me and add the hashtag #larajadeselfportraitchallenge - I‚Äôd love to see!",2023-11-18 20:23:33,@canonusa
B-vWMGkAP7I,9702158,1881,"It has almost been a year since I filmed my online course ‚ÄòThe Business Of Fashion Photography‚Äô so I thought I would re-share the trailer! 
Creating this course wasn‚Äôt an easy task! Breaking down everything business & marketing took months of work. Those that know me know that if I commit to something - I go in 100%! I wanted to create a course that I had never seen created before - a workshop that would answer every question on the business of commercial photography but also help portrait photographers with marketing their work to brands & getting published. 
When I started in the industry around 14 years ago - there was zero guidance. A lot of the time I created blindly. I photographed for me - I didn‚Äôt think about the clients that were potentially out there. I didn‚Äôt think about how I would fit into the market or how to climb the editorial ladder. I didn‚Äôt have a business plan - just a desire to create. It was like a curtain was in front of the questions I wanted answered and every time I would ask.. I would get vague replies. Frustrating to say the least! 
I remember this time last year like it was yesterday - It was a whirlwind few months of gathering content, asking opinions, planning shoots, calls and emails to the @theportraitmasters, lots of coffee & matcha & late nights.. but it was worth it!
It still makes me super happy when someone emails me saying how much the course has helped them! 
What are your business or marketing pain points? Let me know below! Right now is the perfect time to work through business & marketing plans.

I have to say it was also amazing to see so many women involved in a conference - lots of speakers & attendees.

In fact I wasn‚Äôt even aware I could become successful as a female photographer. Vendors, companies - keep this up!

Over the last few days I‚Äôve been reviewing photographers portfolios & branding via my new folio feedback service! I‚Äôve wanted to do this for a long time but never had the time to do so. It‚Äôs been inspiring reviewing work & chatting to photographers over the phone! 
I find it helpful to start my day as I would in a normal work week - getting fully dressed & starting my to do list! I‚Äôm getting so much done. It‚Äôs also a good distraction from what‚Äôs going on in the world! 
It‚Äôs important to keep pushing forward in business - although it‚Äôs a little different to what we are used to.. and of course enjoy the downtime when you can. I‚Äôve been able to catch up on my Netflix watch list & enjoy cooking!

Here are some creative and business ideas to help fill your time... - Start a content plan for social media flatlays are EASY to do! Plan a creative shoot, a self portrait, tell a story, share some old work.
- Shoot your new bio photo - even if it's a self portrait! SO many of you don't have photos of yourselves on your websites or social and this is super important!
- Learn a new photo or retouching technique! How many of you have my online courses but haven't had time to watch the content (or had time to watch all sections!)? Now is the time!
- Start researching clients you could be reaching out to and make a plan of attack for when the industry is running again!
- FaceTime or video call fellow creatives & share ideas! I‚Äôve just discovered the Houseparty app and it‚Äôs so much fun! I highly recommend it.. Stay motivated, keep up the productivity & have fun while doing it!

B-IBXDiAfRM,9702158,5508,"Over the past two years I‚Äôve been exploring another side of the photography realm - beauty and jewelry photography. Which are your favorite shots in the set? 
I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy the process as much as I do and I now find on every shoot (beauty or not) I‚Äôm drawn to capturing the face. Give me a beauty moment over a full length shot any day! I always welcome change in my work because ultimately we are always on a journey as artists. What I photographed at at the beginning of my journey is incredibly different to what I do now and I‚Äôm sure in 10-20 years from now I‚Äôll be saying the same thing. 
If you feel connected with your work and you are shooting what you love - change will always happen. Now is the perfect time to experiment and find a new love with your photography! Try new things - a new lighting technique that you are scared of, a whole new area of photography, brush up on those retouching skills, try something different with posing!
Stay safe & well during this time and above all - stay inspired. üñ§",2023-11-18 20:23:56,
B-KS-fhgWUO,9702158,4112,"It‚Äôs not often you see photo gear related posts from me! I‚Äôm not the type of photographer to boast about gear as I don‚Äôt want people to think it‚Äôs gear (and having the most expensive gear) that‚Äôs stopping them from creating. Skilled photographers should be able to create with any gear - hands up if you remember my ‚Äòcheap camera challenge‚Äô video with DigitalRev a few years ago?! üñê

I started photography as a teenager with hardly any money in my pocket. My early work was shot using point & shoot cameras - just as digital photography was on the rise. I was proud of every little camera I owned and I used each one to the point of breaking! My first DSLR was a Canon 350D and my 50mm lens had an ongoing issue which meant it could only be manually focused. I got so used to it and never wanted to send it in for repair! I also couldn‚Äôt afford to! 
So many photographers ask what gear I use & I wanted to share what‚Äôs in my current gear bag. Since I have a lot of time on my hands I thought I‚Äôd create some content that would give you more of an insight into the creative side of my business - more of it coming soon!

In the industry I am in there is a level of importance to have gear that fits my clients requests - this is why I own a few bodies & a variety of lenses. Fashion & beauty work demand different techniques. 
Let me talk you through the gear - scroll to the next image to associate numbers with list below! For those that want to know my most used lens - I‚Äôd say it would be the 85mm 1.2! 
1. Canon EOS R body + 28-70mm f/2.0 lens
2. Canon 50mm f/1.2 lens - EOS R fit
3. Canon 5D MKIV body
4. Canon 100mm f/2.8 Macro Lens 
5. Canon 50mm f/1.2 Lens
6. Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 Lens
7. Canon 5D MKIV body (back up cam) + Canon 85mm f/1.2 Lens

B5dyDnFgABd,9702158,5657,"A few truths here today! When I started my business back in 2007 on a shoestring budget I had to figure out everything business related from scratch. There were no courses on the business of photography & there seemed to be a secret veil around that side of the industry. I didn‚Äôt have any mentors or anyone to reach out to for advice. It was frustrating to say the least. It took me years of trial & error to learn how to best reach out to people, who to reach out to (within a brand) to pitch my ideas, how to run a production professionally, how to get my work published

Once I figured out a successful business marketing plan a few years ago, my career started to flourish and I started getting the clients I always wanted, shoot the work I was most inspired by and in turn - get repeat work

These are all things I cover in my course so that you can get it right early on or make those changes to help better your success in this industry! What‚Äôs more - I‚Äôve also created several beautiful customizable templates - called the photographer‚Äôs production pack - inc call sheet templates, production checklist & equipment lists

I know the business side of the industry can feel secretive and frustrating (let‚Äôs be honest!). All the leg work is done to set the foundation right so that you can get straight to business & start putting everything into practice. 
Believe me, setting a foundation early on makes opportunities happen faster - enabling you to grow your business quicker! You owe it to yourself to get paid for all of the hard work you do. You‚Äôve done the creative work, now it‚Äôs time to be a better photographer in business

This is a project that I put my heart and soul into and a topic that I‚Äôve wanted to go into depth on for years and I‚Äôm so happy to hear your great feedback so far! 
www.larajadebusiness.com

I wanted to address a common misconception since I shoot fashion and ‚Äòfashion‚Äô is in the name of the course. This course isn‚Äôt just for fashion photographers - portrait photographers can greatly benefit from many of the sections on this course! From marketing to business tips and in the 3 demo shoots themselves. There‚Äôs also a dedicated section for those in smaller markets and who want to start collaborating with brands and expand their editorial and commercial portfolio. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to get your work published but don‚Äôt know how - I address everything there is to know about the editorial world in the course too. Published work only makes your work more desirable when you‚Äôre a portrait photographer!

Have you got the course or interested in owning it in the future? I‚Äôm interested to hear how it has helped you so far! üì∏ by @kristieleephotographer",2023-11-18 20:26:20,@kristieleephotographer

After I released my first course ‚ÄòThe Fashion Series‚Äô (which covers the creative side of the fashion photography industry) I immediately started planning the next one. There is nothing like this out there and that‚Äôs why I wanted to take on the challenge. For some reason there‚Äôs a curtain in front of the business side of the commercial / fashion photography industry and I‚Äôve never understood why as it‚Äôs so open and accessible in other genres! 
I can‚Äôt wait to share more news with you very soon!  For now enjoy these sneak peeks and let me know - what do you struggle with the most when thinking of the business side of photography? üì∑ by @jencoffin",2023-11-18 20:27:48,@jencoffin

When I started there was no information on starting a photography business in fashion, info on how to get published, shoot production and set know how, pitching to clients, pricing your work, understanding licensing etc.. to say the least it was very very frustrating that there was a wall up and I often felt like giving up!

I chose a long time ago to keep my overheads low and choose a space in Brooklyn that worked for me - to be able to constantly produce content without the pressure of spending hundreds - thousands a month on studios. For larger shoots there‚Äôs always the option of booking studios & course many of my clients have their own preference on where to shoot!

Bv1Xdv7gaQM,9702158,2438,"I just wrapped a workshop in NY with this lovely crew! I started doing workshops around 8 years ago. There was very little hands on fashion photography education when I started in the industry. I was frustrated. A lot of what I learned was trial and error and trying to replicate what I saw.. and trying to be unique by listening to what I loved to shoot. Growing up with the rise of social media (hey DeviantART members!) and utilizing the digital marketing aspect as much as I could - I was able to grow my business quite quickly, realizing this wasn‚Äôt just a local industry but I could reach an international audience. Also being a photographer who starts in their teens means no $$ and finding any way and means to be creative and up the production value. I became good at both of those things because I wanted to succeed. You have to be a brilliant creative even when you‚Äôre given the most difficult brief, know how to work with a budget and run with it and at the same time have a good business brain - know when to say no, target to the right clients and you‚Äôre always future thinking + setting intentions with the work you do. I became an educator to guide other photographers on what it is to be both of those things + how to navigate the commercial industry.

It was wonderful to catch up with so many industry friends over the 4 days, sit in some inspiring talks and talk to many of you who attended my seminar.
My seminar topic was Fashion Flair and how it can be the magic ingredient in elevating your work - whether you shoot editorial style weddings, portrait photography or are getting started in fashion photography.
If you enjoyed the talk - you'll find my recent education launch 'The Fashion Series' super helpful. With over 18 hours of content + downloads.

BtEwIyWgEHg,9702158,6635,"I posted this on my Facebook page a while back but I think it‚Äôs worth a repost! 
If you ever view an artist's career (or anyone in business for that matter) and think that their path has been easy - think again. What you see is the successes. No one likes to talk about failures because it's a sign of weakness. Instead, we should be embracing them.

At 14 I started photography and was often laughed at by fellow school friends who thought the idea was ridiculous. 
At 16 during my photography diploma I was told my dreams were too big and to start thinking smaller. The suggestion was to 'focus on being an assistant'. Instead I worked on personal projects and pitched ideas to magazines with the intent of one day being an international photographer. 
At 17 I applied for a prestigious university to pursue my photography passion and didn't get in. Despite the set back and hurt from rejection I decided to register my photography business and a plan of action. 
At 18 I met several photo editors in Europe to be told my work wasn't 'perfected' enough and that I was too 'green'. At 19 I decided to go full steam into fashion photography (doing less and less conceptual work) but was told by my peers, clients and people I admired that the fashion industry is dominated by males and I would ""find it difficult to make a name for myself as a young woman"". Whilst living in London I also found it a struggle to pay rent whilst invest into my career so I had to move back to my hometown for a while. Whilst this was a setback it enabled me to focus on the bigger picture. 
At 21 I moved to NYC and was told ""I would never make it in such a competitive place"". Well I'm still here 8 years later! If you have a dream go for it and learn to embrace failure. No success comes without it.

Bp12JhGA3te,9702158,3050,"I created the bridal challenge as part of The Fashion Series to show wedding photographers (and fashion photographers who shoot bridal) that you can build your portfolio in a more editorial way for publication and attract your dream clients. Adding that fashion edge to the portfolio modernizes your work and allows you to be more creative. I often get asked the question ‚ÄúHow do you get published?‚Äù and my answer is always that first your work needs to be of a level of publication and have direction. You should always be shooting with an ‚Äúeditorial eye‚Äù. Through the challenge videos I often talk about this and how i approach it. I am showing how it‚Äôs possible to add a fashion theme to many areas of photography - through trends, shoot prep, lighting techniques and posing. This is not just for fashion photographers. Fashion as a theme is important for many photographers to pay attention to. This shot was created with a second-hand dress I found online and a simple black seamless backdrop.

BkgdfIBn-5s,9702158,5315,"After filming in LA for a few weeks I felt the need to do a shoot for ME. Often it‚Äôs very easy to make excuses as to why you can‚Äôt be artistic and create. I do it. I make excuses all the time - whether it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not shooting ‚Äòfor a client or magazine‚Äô, not having the right stylist, creative team or it‚Äôs just not the right timing. 
On this shoot I pulled clothes from a friends closet and teamed up with a local LA agency + make up / hair artist and created this. A couple of hours on the beach. Almost no EQ except two black v-flats to block the sun + one friend to help hold them. It‚Äôs easy to think fashion photographers have it easy because they have teams and I am the first to admit having a team makes your job a whole lot easier. HOWEVER that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from going out and creating for yourself. This is how everyone starts. Portfolio building is a super important step to learning and making those connections.
The project I‚Äôve been working on LA will change those thoughts. I want to show you how easy it is to get out there and create stunning imagery on a budget and to stop that voice in your head say ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that because...‚Äô",2023-11-18 20:34:51,

BkjGCjTHUd4,9702158,5838,"Recently I sat down with the guys at @rggedu where we talked all things photography. I believe everyone has an interesting story. Mine isn‚Äôt necessarily the grandfather-had-darkroom scenario but it‚Äôs one that I think you can all relate to. It‚Äôs funny to think if I had started photography 20-30 years ago at the age of fourteen - it would have been extremely difficult to get noticed. I have to thank social media (despite its difficulties) as a platform for sharing my work with the world. It‚Äôs how I grew - with confidence and technicality and through the guidance I received. It‚Äôs strange to imagine myself as a shy fourteen year old photographer with a dream and a point + shoot camera. I would have laughed if I‚Äôd heard I‚Äôd be traveling the world doing photography as a full time job. 
If you have a spare moment take a listen to the podcast. I wanted to share my thoughts on the industry and how it is to be an international photographer. Listen here: https://soundcloud.com/rggedupodcast/",2023-11-18 20:34:51,@rggedu
BkmcCyBnZjG,9702158,4936,En route to Paris today for an exciting shoot and over breakfast I was thinking about my early years in photography and what terrified me the most. FACT: I used to be scared of studio lighting. College didn‚Äôt teach me anything technical and during my first year of university (before leaving) I became even more overwhelmed with the thought of being in the studio. When I look back I wonder why it wasn‚Äôt easier for colleges or universities to simplify set ups. There was also nothing online which just made matters worse when it came to me being terrified of the studio! Over the last five years I stopped being scared. I educated myself on what lighting I liked (natural light) and the WHY - translating it into studio set ups that I felt were most inspiring. Low and behold the most simple set ups were the most effective for me (like this shoot here for @sachinandbabi). I can‚Äôt wait to share what I have in store for you soon - I‚Äôm going to teach you to not be afraid of lighting and I‚Äôm going to tell you WHY. Stay tuned!,2023-11-18 20:34:51,@sachinandbabi

I envisioned this shoot in my head for quite a few years but never felt quite ready to shoot it or the production never felt quite complete. When I finally got around to shooting it I was so nervous it wouldn't turn out the same way I saw it in my head. I am very much a perfectionist and every element has to be RIGHT for me to feel confident that a story will turn out. 
There were tons of challenges on the day (including very heavy overhead light by the time we started shooting on the bridge!), people traffic (always) and it being a very warm day. The challenges actually made me love this shoot even more and gave me the encouragement to bring more ideas to life. 
Which brings me to tell you that my seminar at @thephotographyshow this weekend - Tuesday will be about my successes but mainly my failures... because failures are the things that drive us to achieve more, try harder and dream bigger.

I am so inspired by the journey of @britishvogue and how each photographer's vision has shaped the magazine over the years. For me, Vogue should always be a fantasy. I want to live on the pages. I know there's a place for it but I just don't relate (as an artist) to the raw and exposed imagery we see in a lot of today's magazines. I want to create images that people want to escape to. Of course, ultimately fashion photography is about selling fashion and the lifestyle but in my opinion - an image should always grab your attention and hold it. As photographers, let's be inspired by what once was huge in the photo industry - beautiful artistic fashion imagery. The images you see within this exhibition are all memorable and timeless pieces. That is what I hope to achieve in years to come. #nationalportraitgallery",2023-11-18 21:04:46,@nationalportraitgallery

We've waited a while to put this out but @suebryce has just published the HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR shoot she did. 
My name is all over this shoot. Not only was I IN the campaign, I also SHOT part of it and did the lighting direction. I'm sharing the image of @larajadephotography and I as Bogey and Bacall. 
In her blog post, Sue shares some technical details and shows the before and after images. As well as the image I shot of Sue as Elizabeth Taylor!
